Introduction
============

DeveloperBox is a certified 96boards Enterprise Edition board. The board/SoC has: -

* Socionext SC2A11 24-cores ARM Cortex-A53 on tbe Mini-ATX form factor motherboard
* 4 DIMM slots (4GB DDR4-2400 UDIMM shipped by default)
* 1 4xPCIe Gen2 slot and 2 1xPCIe Gen2 slots
  (1x slots are connected via PCIe bridge chip)
* 4 USB-3.0 ports
* 2 SATA ports
* 1 GbE network port
* 1 USB-UART serial port (micro USB)
* 64MB SPI NOR Flash
* 8GB eMMC Flash Storage
* 96boards LS connector

The DeveloperBox schematic can be found here: -
https://www.96boards.org/documentation/enterprise/developerbox/hardware-docs/mzsc2am_v03_20180115_a.pdf

And the other documents can be found here: -
https://www.96boards.org/documentation/enterprise/developerbox/


Currently, the U-Boot port supports: -

* USB
* eMMC
* SPI-NOR
* SATA
* GbE

The DeveloperBox boots the TF-A and EDK2 as a main bootloader by default.
The DeveloperBox U-Boot port will replace the EDK2 and boot from TF-A as
BL33, but no need to combine with it.

Compile from source
===================

You can build U-Boot without any additinal source code.::

  cd u-boot
  export ARCH=arm64
  export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
  make SynQuacer_defconfig
  make -j `noproc`

Then, expand the binary to 1MB for preparing flash.::

  cp u-boot.bin SPI_NOR_UBOOT.fd
  truncate -s 1M SPI_NOR_UBOOT.fd

Installation
============

You can install the SNI_NOR_UBOOT.fd via NOR flash writer.

Flashing the U-Boot image on DeveloperBox requires a 96boards UART mezzanine or other mezzanine which can connect to LS-UART0 port.
Connect USB cable from host to the LS-UART0 and set DSW2-7 to ON, and turn the board on again. The flash writer program will be started automatically; donâ€™t forget to turn the DSW2-7 off again after flashing.

*!!CAUTION!! If you failed to write the U-Boot image on wrong address, the board can be bricked. See below page if you need to recover the bricked board. See the following page for more detail*

https://www.96boards.org/documentation/enterprise/developerbox/installation/board-recovery.md.html

When the serial flasher is running correctly is will show the following boot messages shown via LS-UART0::


  /*------------------------------------------*/
  /*  SC2A11 "SynQuacer" series Flash writer  */
  /*                                          */
  /*  Version: cd254ac                        */
  /*  Build: 12/15/17 11:25:45                */
  /*------------------------------------------*/

  Command Input >

Once the flasher tool is running we are ready flash the UEFI image::

  flash rawwrite 200000 100000
  >> Send SPI_NOR_UBOOT.fd via XMODEM (Control-A S in minicom) <<

*!!NOTE!! The flasher command parameter is different from the command for board recovery. U-Boot uses the offset 200000 (2-five-0, 2M in hex) and the size 100000 (1-five-0, 1M in hex).*

After transferring the SPI_NOR_UBOOT.fd, turn off the DSW2-7 and reset the board.


Enable FWU Multi Bank Update
============================

DeveloperBox supports the FWU Multi Bank Update. You *MUST* update both *SCP firmware* and *TF-A* for this feature. This will change the layout and the boot process but you can switch back to the normal one by changing the DSW 1-4 off.

Configure U-Boot
----------------

To enable the FWU Multi Bank Update on the DeveloperBox, you need to add following configurations to configs/synquacer_developerbox_defconfig ::

 CONFIG_FWU_MULTI_BANK_UPDATE=y
 CONFIG_FWU_MDATA_MTD=y
 CONFIG_CMD_FWU_METADATA=y
 CONFIG_TOOLS_MKFWUMDATA=y

And build it::

  cd u-boot/
  export ARCH=arm64
  export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
  make synqucer_developerbox_defconfig
  make -j `noproc`
  cd ../

By default, the CONFIG_FWU_NUM_BANKS and COFNIG_FWU_NUM_IMAGES_PER_BANKS are set to 2 and 1 respectively. This uses FIP (Firmware Image Package) type image which contains TF-A, U-Boot and OP-TEE (the OP-TEE is optional.)
You can use fiptool to compose the FIP image from those firmware images.

Rebuild SCP firmware
--------------------

Rebuild SCP firmware which supports FWU Multi Bank Update as below::

  cd SCP-firmware/
  OUT=./build/product/synquacer
  ROMFW_FILE=$OUT/scp_romfw/$SCP_BUILD_MODE/bin/scp_romfw.bin
  RAMFW_FILE=$OUT/scp_ramfw/$SCP_BUILD_MODE/bin/scp_ramfw.bin
  ROMRAMFW_FILE=scp_romramfw_release.bin

  make CC=$ARM_EMB_GCC PRODUCT=synquacer MODE=release
  tr "\000" "\377" < /dev/zero | dd of=${ROMRAMFW_FILE} bs=1 count=196608
  dd if=${ROMFW_FILE} of=${ROMRAMFW_FILE} bs=1 conv=notrunc seek=0
  dd if=${RAMFW_FILE} of=${ROMRAMFW_FILE} bs=1 seek=65536
  cd ../

And you can get the `scp_romramfw_release.bin` file

Rebuild TF-A and FIP
--------------------

Rebuild TF-A which supports FWU Multi Bank Update as below::

  cd arm-trusted-firmware/
  make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j`nproc` PLAT=synquacer \
     SPD=opteed SQ_RESET_TO_BL2=1 GENERATE_COT=1 MBEDTLS_DIR=../mbedtls \
     BL33=../u-boot/u-boot.bin all fip fiptool

And make a FIP image.::

  cp build/synquacer/release/fip.bin SPI_NOR_NEWFIP.fd
  tools/fiptool/fiptool update --tb-fw build/synquacer/release/bl2.bin SPI_NOR_NEWFIP.fd


UUIDs for the FWU Multi Bank Update
-----------------------------------

FWU multi-bank update requires some UUIDs. The DeveloperBox platform uses following UUIDs.

 - Location UUID for the FIP image: 17e86d77-41f9-4fd7-87ec-a55df9842de5
 - Image type UUID for the FIP image: 10c36d7d-ca52-b843-b7b9-f9d6c501d108
 - Image UUID for Bank0 : 5a66a702-99fd-4fef-a392-c26e261a2828
 - Image UUID for Bank1 : a8f868a1-6e5c-4757-878d-ce63375ef2c0

These UUIDs are used for making a FWU metadata image.

Generate FWU metadata image
---------------------------

Before installation, you need to generate a FWU metadata image file by mkfwumdata command as below::

 tools/mkfwumdata -i 1 -b 2 "17e86d77-41f9-4fd7-87ec-a55df9842de5,10c36d7d-ca52-b843-b7b9-f9d6c501d108,5a66a702-99fd-4fef-a392-c26e261a2828,a8f868a1-6e5c-4757-878d-ce63375ef2c0" fwu-mdata.img

Then, you can get the `fwu-mdata.img` image file.

Install via flash writer
------------------------

As explained in above section, the new FIP image and the FWU metadata image can be installed via NOR flash writer. Note that the installation offsets for the FWU multi bank update supported firmware.

Once the flasher tool is running we are ready flash the images. At first, please install FWU metadata at 0x500000 (primary) and 0x530000 (secondary).::

  flash rawwrite 500000 60
  >> Send fwu-mdata.img via XMODEM (Control-A S in minicom) <<

  flash rawwrite 530000 60
  >> Send fwu-mdata.img via XMODEM (Control-A S in minicom) <<

And write the FIP image to the 0x600000 offset.::

  flash rawwrite 600000 180000
  >> Send SPI_NOR_NEWFIP.fd via XMODEM (Control-A S in minicom) <<

And write the new SCP firmware.::

  flash write cm3
  >> Send scp_romramfw_release.bin via XMODEM (Control-A S in minicom) <<

At last, turn on the DSW 3-4 on the board, and reboot.
Note that if DSW 3-4 is turned off, the DeveloperBox will boot from
the original EDK2 firmware (or non-FWU U-Boot if you already installed.)
