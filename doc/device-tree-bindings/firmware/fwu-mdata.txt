FWU Metadata Access Devicetree Binding

The FWU Multi Bank Update feature uses a metadata structure, stored on
a separate partition for keeping information on the set of updatable
images. The device tree node provides information on the storage
device that contains the FWU metadata.

Required properties :

- compatible : "u-boot,fwu-mdata-gpt";
- fwu-mdata-store : should point to the storage device which contains
		    the FWU metadata partition.

Example :
	fwu-mdata {
		compatible = "u-boot,fwu-mdata-gpt";
		fwu-mdata-store = <&sdmmc1>;
	};
