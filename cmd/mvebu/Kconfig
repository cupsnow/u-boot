	  Introduction: NAND vendors conducts tests to verify if all blocks are
	  OK. In case of failure block, the NAND manufacturer will mark this
	  block as bad (BBM) by setting 0x00 somewhere in the spare area.
	  Moreover NAND manufacturer can pre-programmed the chip with provided
	  image using external burner.

	  Issue: Marvell NFC employ optimized cost/performance ECC mechanism.
	  This results in an unique ECC layout implementation. Marvell NFC sets
	  different layouts according to page size/ECC strength combinations.

	  Therefore after preparing image for the NAND manufacturer for board
	  with Marvell NFC, due to the layout differences used by Marvell NFC
	  and physical NAND chip layout, some valid data will be put on BBM
	  position.  This will result on false bad block indicator and will
	  affect the BBT which is created automatically (by U-Boot or Linux)
	  during first run.

	  To prevent from that kind of situations, the NAND oem command was
	  introduced.

	  The "prepare" part of the command runs once per device data partition
	  in NAND and prepares image which is next send to manufacturer. It
	  checks if under BBM position there is no data which could be then
	  mistakenly taken as a BBM. If so the data together with tracking
	  information is copied to "meta-data" partition and BBM position is
	  overwritten with good indicator.

	  The "restore" part of the command runs once per "prepared" partition
	  and restores its original data. It supposed to run on new boards, on
	  which the NAND manufacturer pre-programmed earlier prepared image.

	bool "mv_get_counters"

	help

	  First argument select eth port to print.
	  When no argument is given default port is Ethact.
	  Wrong port being selected could cause crash.
